# Ideal-Team-Structures-in-Scientific-Research
The number of multi-authored papers is rising. Authors from different backgrounds and qualifications are increasingly collaborating on scientific projects. Historically, researchers have stated that collaboration increases productivity, but the majority of researchers focus on studying factors that foster collaboration among scientists. This study tries to create a direct link between collaboration and productivity by identifying team structures that lead to successful outcomes in scientific research. 

It asks two major questions:
- Can patterns in individual co author contributions predict research success?
- Can the diverse composition of co authors predict research success?

To answer these questions, the study proposes three hypotheses:
- Bigger teams have bigger success
- Individual author contributions matter
- Diverse teams have bigger success
